# Paris 2024 Olympics Medal Barplot (ggplot2)

This repository contains a simple R script that generates a stacked bar chart showing the top 10 countries by total medals at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Each bar represents a country and is divided into colored segments corresponding to gold, silver, and bronze medals.

The main purpose of this script is to demonstrate how to build stacked bar plots using ggplot2. The dataset is intentionally minimal and created directly within the script, as the focus is on visualization rather than data collection or data cleaning.

# What this script does

Uses ggplot2 to create a stacked bar chart (gold, silver, bronze)
